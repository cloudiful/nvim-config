# 😈 My personal nvim setup 🔧

It is basically LazyVim💤 with Catppuccin🐱 theme and transparent🪟 background

## Setup

### With Internet 🛜

If you want to use my config, backup your config files first
(ignore if you are new to neovim)

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
```

then clone this repo into ~/.config/nvim/

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudiful/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim/
```

### Offline Setup 🕸️

If you want to use nvim in an offline environment, check out the [release page](https://github.com/cloudiful/nvim-config/releases).
